<b>Did you upload your files but are still seeing this message?</b>

<p>

If yes, make sure you uploaded your files to the "www" directory. All web files

must be in this directory. Everything above it is private storage that is not

accessible from the web.

<p>

If you still can not see your site, delete the file "index.html" (the name of the file

you are viewing). If you named your index file index.htm it is not being shown because index.html is

searched for before index.htm, default.htm, index.php, index.phtml, etc.
